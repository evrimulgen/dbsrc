	DBSRC Librarian is a utility for comprehensive, flexible, performant DDL
	export of large database systems consisting of hundreds of thousands of
	DDL objects (or more).

	This is not a complete utility, not is it production ready, so comes with
	no warranties in any way whatsoever. This utility has not be productized or
	packaged for ease-of-use or understandability. It is simply a prototype to
	explore feasibility. Having said all that, I share it freely in case it
	may be useful to someone somehow...

/COPYING.txt

	GNU Public License details.

/DESIGN_NOTES.txt

	"under the hood" notes for those who want to understand how it works.

/HOW_TO_USE.txt

	Instructions on how to use this program.	

/init.bat
	
	Edit script values to match your environment. Run this to set file path
	and database credentials within the cmd window you will use to execute
	scripts from /bin.

/README.txt

	This file.

/WISHLIST.txt
	
	TO-DOs that might be useful one day, recorded so that they are not
	forgotten.

/bin

	The "user interface": a handful of windows batch scripts.  Scripts
	starting with "_" (underscore) are "helper scripts" called by other
	scripts, not intended to be executed directly.

/cfg/

	  Each "configuration" for exporting the DDL for a system is captured in a
	  "configuration" script in this dir.

/log

	Scripts in /bin log to this directory. The logfile naming convention is
	[script_name]_yyyymmdd_hh24miss.log.

/out 

	Database Source generated by DBSRC Librarian is written to this directory.
	Review EXAMPLE output in the /out directory to see example output.  There
	are two example sets of Database Source Code produced by the DBSRC
	Librarian:

	dbsrc/out/selftest_example/

		EXAMPLE Database source for the DBSRC Librarian, generated by the
		DBSRC Librarian.

	dbsrc/out/all_example/

		EXAMPLE Database source for all interesting objects in an Oracle 12.1
		db.

/sql

	Most SQL scripts are "under the hood" and are called by Windows batch
	scripts in the /bin dir.
